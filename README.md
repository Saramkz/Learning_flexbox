# Learning_flexbox
I re-learned how to create a div and add multiples images in it.
I learned about a first cool effect "transition" / "transform"
And I used flex ! I LUUUUV IT. I went to flexbox froggy to understand better hot it works :
-> justify-content is horizontal / align-items is vertical, and then you have flex-directions, when applied that inverse the properties of the two before.
